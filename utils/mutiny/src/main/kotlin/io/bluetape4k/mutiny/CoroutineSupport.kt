 * Produce a [Uni] from given [block] in a non-suspending context.
 *
 * The [suspendSupplier] block isn't attached to the structured concurrency of the current `coroutineContext` by default
 * but executed in the [GlobalScope], that means that failures raised from [suspendSupplier] will not be
 * thrown immediately but propagated to the resulting [Uni], similar to the behavior of `Uni.createFrom().item<T>(() -> T)`.
 * The behaviour can be changed by passing an own [context] that's used for `coroutines` execution of the given [suspendSupplier].
